Mentoring is a rewarding experience that lets you collaborate and help students achieve their goals. Mentors can provide help like technical (engineering / programming) training, organisation (planning, financial, etc.) or just general support (keep students on track, track goals, etc.). Mentors mean the world to students, and you will be able to learn and experience a variety of challenges with students.
