# Volunteer

Volunteering is a rewarding experience, allowing you to interact and help bright young students achieve their dreams. There are a variety of volunteering positions available for all kinds of skill levels and abilities. We are always looking for more people to help out.

You can volunteer your time for the event (April 4-5) or help in preparations. All help is very much appreciated.

To apply as a volunteer, email [volunteer@frcwest.com](mailto:volunteer@frcwest.com).
