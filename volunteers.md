# Volunteer

Volunteering is a rewarding experience, allowing you to interact and help bright young students achieve their dreams. There are a variety of volunteering positions available for all kinds of skill levels and abilities (technical and non-technical). We are always looking for more people to help out.

A full list of positions can be found [here](https://my.usfirst.org/FIRSTPortal/Login/VIMS_Login.aspx).

You can volunteer your time for the event (April 4-5) or help in preparations. All help is very much appreciated.

To apply as an event volunteer, sign up [here](https://my.usfirst.org/FIRSTPortal/Login/VIMS_Login.aspx).

To apply as a mentor, sign up [here](/mentors).
