There are two options for joining an FRC team. Your choice is dependant on your school, location and personal preference.

## School Teams
If you go to a school with an FRC established, it's highly recommended you join that team. If not, it's still possible to join a school team. This is usually dependant on the school's preference for recruiting. If the team is open to accepting students outside of the school - it's a great opportunity.

## Community Teams
Your other option as a student is to join a community. Community teams are run and regulated outside of a school. Usually, community teams offer more freedom and flexibility. For students without a school team, community teams offer a great opportunity for meeting new people. They also develop leadership skills well, because you are more independent.
