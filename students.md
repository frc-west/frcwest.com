There are two options for joining an FRC team. Your choice is dependant on your school, location and personal preference.

## School Teams
If you go to a school with an FRC established, it's highly recommended you join that team. If not, it's still possible to join a school team. This is usually dependant on the school's preference for recruiting. If the team is open to accepting students outside of the school - it's a great opportunity.

To apply to a school team, fill the forms and send:

<form action="MAILTO:findateam@frcwest.com?Subject=School Team" method="post" enctype="text/plain">

Name:<br>
<input type="text" name="name"><br>

Age:<br>
<input type="text" name="age"><br>

Location:<br>
<input type="text" name="location"><br>

School:<br>
<input type="text" name="school"><br>

About me:<br>
<textarea type="text" name="about-me"></textarea><br>

<input type="submit" value="Send">
</form>

## Community Teams
Your other option as a student is to join a community. Community teams are run and regulated outside of a school. Usually, community teams offer more freedom and flexibility. For students without a school team, community teams offer a great opportunity for meeting new people. They also develop leadership skills well, because you are more independent.

To apply to a community team, fill the forms and send:

<form action="MAILTO:findateam@frcwest.com?Subject=Community Team" method="post" enctype="text/plain">

Name:<br>
<input type="text" name="name"><br>

Age:<br>
<input type="text" name="age"><br>

Location:<br>
<input type="text" name="location"><br>

About me:<br>
<textarea type="text" name="about-me"></textarea><br>

<input type="submit" value="Send">
</form>
