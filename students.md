FRC Teams challenge students to design, strategize, fund and build a robot that will compete at a very high level of competition. It's fun, engaging, social and challenging for students.

There are teams all over Calgary and Alberta! See if your school has a team, or sign up for a community team by emailing [about@frcwest.com](mailto:about@frcwest.com).
