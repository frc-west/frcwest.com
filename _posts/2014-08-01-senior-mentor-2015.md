FRC West is happy to announce that we have started a senior mentor program in the region. FIRST has expanded the senior mentor program to include international regions, and we will be receiving two mentors.

Our region is familiar with these two characters, and we're sure you'll be happy to hear that **Joel Gallant** and **Craig Maynard** have been selected.

Joel has been a fundamental part of the region for the past few years, and we're happy to see him move to this new position.

Craig is one of the originators of FIRST in the region. He's been immensely helpful throughout our few years here, winning the Woodie Flowers award in 2013.

### What does a FIRST Senior Mentor do?

A FIRST Senior Mentors supports all four FIRST programs in a part-time capacity through communication and collaboration with their Regional Director, Program Partners, Regional/Planning/Operational Committees, and other key individuals in their region. A FIRST Senior Mentor works within a 100 mile radius of their residence to support teams, mentors, and coaches.
