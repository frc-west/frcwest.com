This is the third year of FRC is Western Canada, wow!

A lot of challenges have come up over the years, but most have been quickly solved. Most of our initial struggles were recruiting enough schools and students for teams in the area. At this point, we've been successful to a degree never seen before in FRC.

Unfortunately, we face a new upcoming struggle. This struggle is keeping teams around. Everyone wishes that this wasn't an issue and teams just stuck around forever. But in reality, teams encounter a lot of hardship in their first few years - notably in funding and mentorship.
I'm sure everyone in FRC has at one point seen this challenge on their team, or teams around them. It's the reason team numbers are up to 5000 but teams are still around 2500-3000.


We at FRC West aren't going to standby on this issue. We're working hard to ensure every *single* team stays around. Part of that mission is what we're calling our "Team Model".
The team model is a document we've produced to give teams a starting place for planning, organizing and administrating their teams. It details subjects like funding, recruitment, mentorship and scheduling.


And that's not it. I (Joel Gallant) will be working throughout the year to help teams in the region. Whether it be technical questions, looking for advice or simply want to discuss FRC in general - I'm here for you guys.


I'll be writing blog posts here updating you about what's happening in FRC West, mostly related directly (stuff you care about) - I can't promise you'll find everything useful though.


I've already sent emails to team contacts, and I'd like to get a conversation going with every team. Treat me as a resources wherever you need me. If I don't have the expertise directly, I likely know where to point you.


Thanks everyone, looking forward to speaking to everyone!
