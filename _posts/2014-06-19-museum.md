Maybe you have heard of a mysterious private museum nestled in a bunker hidden away north west of Cochrane. The Canadian Museum of Making [http://www.museumofmaking.com/](http://www.museumofmaking.com/) Only open a few days a year Calgary and Area First Robotics teams, thanks to SWATbots 5015's Average Joe Willis, we have which may be a once in lifetime opportunity, a chance to visit Sunday September 15th, 2014. 

This is an amazing Museum, probably the best museum in the world. Prepare to be astonished by one of the rarest collections in the world, that only a few people have ever had the opportunity to see.

We will be contacting teams with invitations - be sure to take advantage of the opportunity!
