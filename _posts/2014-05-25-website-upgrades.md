We've made some changes to the frcwest website, and will continue to do so over the next few weeks/months. Hopefully you like them!

Notably, we've

- Changed the theme to a lighter style with a well defined footer
- Changed the look of the homepage, adding a small promo video to increase interest
- Added a blogging component, to keep teams and parents updated about FRC in Western Canada
- Changed to sidebar, removing pictures and favouring content for teams and from teams
- Made "Join a team" pages nicer looking
- Added a detailed infographic on our about page for FRC
- Upgraded some internals (CSS backend)

Our site is very minimal for a reason - we don't want clutter! The idea of frcwest.com is to give local teams a place to find exactly what they need. There's no need to try and distract or advertise anything to you.

Let us know what you think! If you have questions, suggestions or bug reports let us know through email or social media.
