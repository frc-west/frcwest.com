Hello teams of 2014-2015!

Here's some key information that you **need to know** for this year.

**Robot demos**: We will need robots to use for demonstrations all over the city in September. If you have a robot to donate for a while, or want to send students to show off your stuff, contact us!

**2015 Season Pre-Registration**: If you haven't started the pre-registration process, we encourage you to do so as soon as possible. Completing the process now will allow you to register for events quickly when event registration opens this fall! Teams can login to update their team profiles for the 2015 season in [TIMS](https://my.usfirst.org/frc/tims/site.lasso), and new rookie teams can also pre-register at this time.

**Team Information Update**: As part of the pre-registration process, all veteran teams must re-enter their school/youth organization information in the Team Profile section in TIMS to ensure that the team's current information is displayed. To do so, the Main (Lead Mentor 1) or Alternate (Lead Mentor 2) Contact must login to TIMS and navigate to the Team Summary page. On the Team Summary page, please select the "edit/view" button in the Team Information section to update your team's school and sponsor information.

**Screening Requirement for Lead Mentors in the U.S. and Canada**: We strongly encourage your team's Main (Lead Mentor 1) and Alternate (Lead Mentor 2) contacts to complete the Youth Protection screening process as soon as possible. The screening must be completed for the Main and Alternate contacts before your team can register for competition events. In most cases, it takes 1-2 business days for the screening to clear. However, we suggest that your Main and Alternate contacts complete the screening no later than Wednesday, 9/10 to ensure that your team is ready for initial event registration on Thursday, 9/25 at 12:00 pm (noon) Eastern Time. As the screening process takes time, you will not be able to complete and pass the screening on the day of registration, so we encourage you to complete the screening as soon as possible.

**Canadian Museum of Making tour**: We want students, parents and mentors to come out on September 14th. More details can be found [here](/2014/06/19/museum/), contact [Joel](mailto:joel@frcwest.com) if you're interested.

**Beakerhead**: Happening on September 10th-12th, teams from FRC West are attending the Beakerhead event "Four-to-Six", on Stephen Avenue. See details [here](http://beakerhead.org/event/four-to-six/2014-09-10/).

**Calgary's Tech Showcase**: On September 11th, FRC West will have a booth at the Innovate Calgary's Tech Showcase. Find details [here](http://www.innovatecalgary.com/events/techshowcase/).

## Message to students and mentors
We want to come present at your school! Please contact us if you can arrange a presentation to students. We can help recruit students for your team, or find people for new community teams in the region.
